# Web-Scraping-using-Scrapy-hindustantimes 

This project was done for Bypolar Factory. 
Here I collected data from hindustantimes news portal. 
I went to its site and first picked all the URLs available on the screen and then went to each page and scraped necessary information like --
Headline,Day,Date,Time and the complete news in the body of the news. 

The tool used for this is Scrapy as it can easily scrape,clean and format large volumes of data easily.
